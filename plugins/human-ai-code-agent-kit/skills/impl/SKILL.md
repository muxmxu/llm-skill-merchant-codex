description: "Implementation workflow for the AI Code Agent, driven by the project's development-rules doc (e.g. ProjectDevelopRule.md): take in and execute implementation task artifacts written by the human or research assistant, check the working tree for compliance with project rules before committing, and init a development-rules doc for a new project. Trigger when the user hands over a task document or asks to implement a specified change following project conventions; asks whether the current changes comply with project rules, are safe to commit, or follow test/commit conventions; or wants to set up development rules in a new project. Also trigger on explicit subcommands: impl init | task | check. suit-for-code-agent"

# impl — implementation workflow

Role: AI Code Agent, **implementation mode** (see `../../references/roles.md`;
a project-local ROLE.txt overrides it). Unlike exp/eval/ops, this skill DOES
change code — under the project's rules doc and the task artifact's scope.

## Doc resolution (loose contract)

The project rules doc is whatever the repo designates (common names:
`ProjectDevelopRule.md`, `DEVELOPMENT.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`; CLAUDE.md often
names it). Loose contract: read the whole doc (plus CLAUDE.md's conventions
section if present) and map onto the capability checklist in
`references/contract.md`. Doc missing → offer `impl init`.

## Orchestration for large tasks

A `task` that is large enough to decompose (a full implementation, a
migration, or a large evaluation sweep) can run in **Code Orchestration
Mode**. The main Codex session decomposes the work into bounded modules,
dispatches independent modules, verifies each result independently, then
performs one integration pass and sends one completion report. Small,
clearly scoped tasks stay single-thread. See
`references/code-orchestration-mode.md`.

## Safety red lines (non-negotiable)

1. **Scope is the task's, not yours.** No speculative refactors, no drive-by
   cleanups, no expanding a task because something nearby looks improvable.
   Out-of-scope findings are reported, not fixed.
2. **Respect the project's protected zones** — areas the rules doc or task
   marks as behavior-frozen (e.g. numerical behavior of training). If a task
   seems to require touching one, stop and surface the conflict.
3. Follow the rules doc's test placement, environment, and commit discipline
   exactly; when it conflicts with your habits, the doc wins.
4. Never commit without running `check` (below) on the working tree.

## Subcommands

### task
Execute an implementation task artifact (see roles.md §2: the task is the
execution target; decisions/references are context).

1. Read the task artifact fully; extract scope, deliverables, exact paths,
   constraints, non-goals, acceptance criteria; read the referenced
   decision/reference artifacts.
2. Inspect the current code before changing it (roles.md §3).
3. Ambiguity or conflict with repo reality → report per roles.md §7 before
   writing code (plan-then-execute gating, roles.md §4).
4. Implement within scope; follow the rules doc for placement, style, tests.
5. Validate per the acceptance criteria + the rules doc's required checks;
   report changed files, results, and open questions faithfully.

### check
Read-only compliance report of the current working tree against the rules
doc. Check at least: file/test placement rules, forbidden staging patterns
(e.g. blanket `git add -A` where the doc forbids it), commit-message rules
(e.g. no AI-attribution lines), protected-zone violations, leftover debug/
scratch files. Output one pass/fail line per rule with the offending paths;
end with "safe to commit" or the blocking items. Never auto-fix — report.

### init
Follow `references/init.md` with `assets/DEVELOPMENT.template.md` — only for
projects with no rules doc. Never overwrite one without confirmation.
