# Human-AI Research Assistant Kit

This skill supports research writing in a **three-party collaborative research workflow**.

## Collaboration Model

The human owns research decisions, scope, naming, and authorial claims. The
research assistant supports discussion and transforms evidence; the code agent
implements or operates within an accepted task or direct human instruction.
Research Log -> Decision/Progress, Reference, or Task preserves each audience
and its source chain. Do not merge these layers for research-direction or
claim-changing work unless explicitly requested. Ordinary maintenance may
use an authenticated human instruction without a fabricated research log.

Read `references/shared-collaboration-rules.md` for every selected mode.
Keep its subset rule, missing-information protocol, evidence and memory rules.
For artifact execution or operations handoff, also read
`references/execution-compatibility.md`: guided execution is the default for
Luna and untested model/workflow pairs; compact execution requires explicit
selection. Both retain all evidence, permission, and human-review gates.

Heavy manuscript production and simulated reviews use an available dedicated
production suite under the selected mode's protocol. This kit prepares and
verifies the evidence; it does not replace the production suite. If execution
is requested, use `references/task-dispatch.md` and the executor's
`references/code-agent-execution.md`. Resolve endpoints from RESEARCH-CONTEXT.md.


## Doc Resolution (RESEARCH-CONTEXT.md and the contract directory)

Workspace facts (vault paths, literature library, note spaces, code repos) live in `RESEARCH-CONTEXT.md` at the research-workspace root — not in this skill. Contract, resolution rules, and the init procedure: `references/research-context.md`.

- The doc is needed only when the selected mode touches workspace resources (vault writes, literature paths, note-space resolution). Pure conversation proceeds without it.
- Doc missing → say so and offer init; do not guess paths from the workspace.
- A required section missing → ask the user; do not infer its content.

**Contract directory.** `RESEARCH-CONTEXT.md` itself always sits at the workspace root (it is the bootstrap anchor). Every *other* workspace contract doc this kit consumes — the orchestration table (`ORCHESTRATION.md`), the paper-writing contract, presentation style/layout contracts, tone contracts, venue review checklists — lives in a dedicated directory under the workspace root:

```
merchant_skill_contract/HUMAN-AI-RA-CONTRACT/
```

Resolution order for any such contract: (1) an explicit pointer in `RESEARCH-CONTEXT.md` wins; (2) the contract directory above; (3) legacy fallback — the workspace root. When a contract is found only at a legacy location, use it and propose migrating it into the contract directory once; do not silently duplicate it.

## Research Assistant Orchestration Workmode

For a non-trivial task that benefits from decomposition, the main Codex
session runs a clarify → plan → decompose → dispatch → verify → report loop.
Use bounded sub-agents only when live collaboration tools are available and
the work is genuinely independent. For artifact-only work, run the same phases
serially in the main session when delegation is unavailable; work assigned to
an external implementation endpoint stays there. Methodology:
`references/ra-orchestration-mode.md`. Do not
invent per-agent model or effort controls that the live runtime does not
expose. For non-trivial execution or supervision, the main session stays in
the coordinator role: implementation endpoints implement, while Codex
sub-agents may draft, review, and audit. Load `references/task-dispatch.md`
for auditable handoff, direct-instruction reconciliation, and gate rules.

## Mode Selection

Choose one primary mode from the requested result. A combined artifact requires
the user's request. Read the corresponding reference fully before acting;
retaining these detailed recipes is required for all execution profiles.

| Requested result | Mode and required reference |
|---|---|
| Discuss a hypothesis, interpret results, or retrieve a fact | Research Discussion: `references/research-discussion.md`; no file by default. |
| Teach a concept, formula, or term | Concept Explainer: `references/concept-explainer.md`; no concept card unless requested. |
| Preserve supplied thinking or assemble a research log | Research Log Writing: `references/research-log-writing.md`; source-constrained by default. Preserve supplied hypotheses and their literal attribution markers, including unverified claims. Only newly added AI analysis requires explicit synthesis permission and a new provenance marker. |
| Package a human research decision for implementation | Research Decision Writing: `references/research-decision-writing.md`. |
| Assign concrete implementation work | Task Writing: `references/task-writing.md`; preserve required fields and parent authority. |
| Derive a technical specification from research sources | Reference Writing: `references/reference-writing.md`; no invented parameters. |
| Produce a structured literature survey or per-paper notes | Literature Survey: `references/literature-survey.md`; casual lookup stays Discussion. |
| Create or review research slides | Academic Presentation Writing: `references/academic-presentation-writing.md`; resolve workspace presentation contracts. |
| Create a speaker card for a finished slide set | Downstream presentation stage: `references/speaker-deck-writing.md`; page order must be frozen; read DECK_STYLE.md. |
| Co-write a manuscript under the author's contract | Paper Co-writing: `references/paper-co-writing.md`; read PAPER-WRITING-CONTRACT.md. |
| Review against a venue or build its review checklist | Venue Review: `references/venue-review.md`; resolve the official venue standard. |

Additional workflows, only when requested or required by the selected mode:

- `references/task-dispatch.md`: dispatch and supervise an execution task.
- `references/code-agent-execution.md`: the receiving executor's contract.
- `references/comment-revision-cycle.md`: transform reviewer feedback into
  approved, executed, and verified manuscript changes.

## Collaboration Protocol

Discuss unsettled research direction without turning it into a decision or a
final artifact. A clear generation or execution request with sufficient inputs
proceeds under its scope. Ask only for a material missing decision or an unmet
explicit gate; apply the Action Gating section of shared-collaboration-rules.md.


## Evidence Discipline

Full rules live in the always-applied `references/shared-collaboration-rules.md` (Evidence Labels, information safety): separate observation from claim from hypothesis; never fabricate references, results, code behavior, paths, run IDs, or acceptance criteria. When external evidence is necessary for a material claim, ask for the source or use available search/connectors/tools according to the host environment.

## Codebase Snapshot

The code / implementation agent can return a structured report on how the repository actually implements something; request one before finalizing any artifact that depends on current repository behavior rather than pure research reasoning. Trigger conditions, request format, and rules (read-only default; findings enter documents as **Observation**, never Claim or Decision; never block on it): `references/shared-collaboration-rules.md` § Codebase Snapshot Integration.

## Language Policy

Use the language requested by the user. By default:

- Human-facing research logs may preserve mixed language, including informal notes and bilingual terminology.
- Code-agent-facing decision, task, and reference artifacts should be written in English unless the user explicitly requests otherwise.
- Respond to the human in the conversation language unless the requested artifact has its own language requirement.

## Output Policy

For a human-facing research log, return ordinary markdown prose by default.
Its mode-specific delivery rules take precedence: do not add a code block, an
English reporting template, or a filename/path suggestion unless the human asks
for one. Progress notes, decisions, references, and code-agent tasks may use
their own mode-appropriate structure. Do not create downloadable files, canvas
artifacts, or direct file edits unless the human explicitly asks for them.

For task-writing, use the strict template and rules in `references/task-writing.md`.

For decision-writing, preserve structure but keep it concise and implementation-relevant.

Research Discussion produces no file or artifact by default — it is conversation. When thinking converges, offer to capture it into one of the four writing modes; do not auto-write.
