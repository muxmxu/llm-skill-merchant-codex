# Research Log Writing

## Purpose

Write or revise human-facing research logs. A research log preserves the human research process: nonlinear thinking, raw observations, hypotheses, evidence chains, decisions, doubts, failed routes, paper notes, experiment interpretation, and Q&A-like reasoning.

A research log is not a code-agent-facing document and does not need to be implementation-ready. It may be a single Obsidian markdown page that mixes research notes, informal reasoning, formulas, experiment results, and temporary decisions.

## Trigger Examples

Use this mode when the user says or implies:

- write a research log
- help me record this thinking
- turn this discussion into an Obsidian note
- organize my research thoughts
- preserve the reasoning chain
- write the human-facing log
- keep the uncertainty / failed idea / hypothesis
- record what I am thinking before turning it into a task or reference

## Core Principles

### Preserve human thinking

Preserve the human's reasoning traces, uncertainty, failed routes, provisional language, and creative jumps. Do not over-clean the log into a final design document, progress note, task, or implementation reference.

### Structure only when useful

If the human provides a skeleton, follow that skeleton. If the human provides scattered notes, lightly organize them into readable sections while preserving the original intent and uncertainty. Do not assume the research process is stored across multiple files.

### Keep research logs human-facing

A research log may later be used to derive a decision note, code-agent task, or technical reference, but it is not itself one of those artifacts. Keep human-facing reasoning intact unless the user asks for a cleaned version.

## Drafting and Style-only Revision Protocol

The single most common failure of this mode: the human dumps a large, messy, stream-of-consciousness passage; the assistant *understands* it correctly; and the written log still reads wrong — over-formalized, voice erased, interpretive gaps silently filled. The failure is in the transformation, not the comprehension. This protocol is the mandatory pipeline for any "here is a pile of my thoughts, make it a log" request.

### Choose the semantic route before drafting

**Source-constrained transformation is the default.** Use it for a style-only
rewrite and for a fresh log assembled from notes, tables, experiment output,
or a completion report the human supplied. “Write this as a log” authorizes
selection, ordering, and expression; it does not authorize new research
reasoning. Treat the input as atomic propositions: values, ranges, fixed
conditions, stated observations, stated limits, and already-marked claims.
Every output sentence must map to one or more of those propositions. It may
join or restate them in ordinary prose, but it may not add a proposition.

In this route, do not introduce a new number, difference, trend, causal
mechanism, exclusion, hypothesis, prediction, falsification condition, open
question, or next step. A matching hash, seed, configuration, or recomputation
remains only that fact; it cannot become a claim that a data, aggregation,
configuration, or other cause has been excluded. If the input contains no
interpretation after a table, the log may end after the observation and its
stated limit. An empty explanation is preferable to a made-up one.

**Explicit AI synthesis is an opt-in route.** Use it only when the human
expressly asks for analysis, explanation, inference, alternative exclusion,
recommendation, or a new AI judgment. Preserve all source propositions and
their existing markers first. Then attach the literal workspace marker
`[AI finding/claim]` to each newly introduced explanation, exclusion, causal
link, recommendation, hypothesis, prediction, falsification condition, open
question, or next step. Do not use an existing marker to cover a new sentence,
and do not mix a source claim and a new AI claim under one marker.

**Step 1 — Choose the lightest safe entry.** When the requested log has one clear topic, or the user asks for a style-only rewrite, draft directly. When multiple threads would change the meaning if separated, state a one-sentence topic split and ask for confirmation before restructuring. Do not turn a clear drafting request into a mandatory interview.

**Step 2 — Resolve tone authority.** A workspace `RESEARCH_WRITE_TONE.md` (or an explicitly approved style exemplar) governs voice and readability. Recent logs may supply terminology, section habits, and the amount of detail, but never become a style authority by themselves. In particular, do not copy a recent log's battle-report, audit, scolding, or completion-report register.

**Step 3 — Register fidelity while drafting.** Apply "Register and Accountability" below, plus these transformation-specific rules:

- The human's hedges are data: 「大概」「感觉」「没验证」"maybe" survive verbatim. Do not upgrade a guess into a claim while smoothing sentences.
- Loose thinking stays loose. No academic connective tissue ("furthermore", "in conclusion"), no invented evidence labels on judgment passages.
- Keep the human's terms in their original language; do not translate variable names, run ids, or terms of art.

**Semantic preflight for every source-constrained transformation.** These
checks protect the record rather than its surface style:

- **MUST NOT** turn a fixed condition (matching hash, seed, configuration, or
  recomputation) into an unstated exclusion such as “not a missing-file error”,
  “not an aggregation error”, or “not a configuration factor”. Repeat the
  confirmed condition as given; any further exclusion needs to be in the source.
- **MUST NOT** strengthen modality or evidence. `可能` / “maybe”, `看起来`,
  `不太像`, and `尚不能` do not become `大概率`, `主要`, `已表明`, `所以`, or
  another stronger causal or evidential claim. These words change what the
  day-T record says, even when the sentence becomes smoother.

**Step 4 — Preserve attribution without manufacturing prose.** A source-constrained transformation may add no explanation at all. Do not invent a connective inference merely to make the prose smoother. If the workspace defines an author-source marker, preserve it literally and on the same claim; do not split, rename, remove, or synthesize markers. In this workspace, `[AI finding/claim]` is that marker. Explicit AI synthesis must use a separate literal marker for every new AI proposition.

**Step 5 — Post-draft self-check, then deliver.** In a source-constrained transformation, verify that every sentence maps to supplied propositions and that facts, scope, negation, chronology, causality, uncertainty, modality, and author-source markers are unchanged. In particular, check every fixed-condition sentence against its source: it may report the condition, but may not name a new error class that it supposedly excludes. Check every hedge and causal connector: it may not become stronger. In explicit AI synthesis, also check that each added research proposition has its own literal `[AI finding/claim]` marker. Use readable paragraphs rather than forcing every sentence into the same length. Keep evidence labels only where the passage is accountable to data, paper, or code. Resolve every `[[wikilink]]` when a checker is available.

### Style-only means semantic substitution, not editorial expansion

When the request says "only change expression", return the revised passage itself.
Do not add a rewrite commentary, a filename suggestion, a new frontmatter field,
a title, a derived calculation, or an extra interpretation unless that material
was already present or the human explicitly asks for it. Replace rhetorical
phrases locally: a harsh conclusion may become a clear written conclusion, but
it must not become a new priority, causal ranking, recommendation, or decision.
Before delivery, compare each provenance-marked claim against its source as a
single unit; the wording may change, while its proposition and force may not.
Treat quantifiers and scope words as part of that unit: do not drop or widen
terms such as “all”, “only”, “each”, “already tested”, a threshold, a date, or
a comparison set.

## Register and Accountability

**Before writing or revising any passage, classify what it is accountable to.** If the answer is the human's own judgment, the experiment structure and the evidence labels are FORBIDDEN for that passage. This classification is an internal routing decision — do not print it, do not tag passages with it.

How much rigor a passage needs is set by what it is accountable to — not by its style and not by how confident it sounds. The operating rule is a binary: a load-bearing experiment gets scientific rigor; everything else stays in the stance the human wrote it in. The table is a teaching aid, not five dials:

| Accountable to… | Apply |
|---|---|
| DATA — a fact you don't control (an experiment) | the experiment register below |
| a PAPER — a source you're reporting | read-before-claim + a cite pointer; tag `[Literature]` |
| the CODE — something readable in the repo | a code fact / Codebase Snapshot; tag `[Code-fact]` |
| only the HUMAN'S OWN JUDGMENT (conjecture, intuition, reflection, decision) | NOTHING — add no evidence apparatus; preserve as-is |

(Provenance tags `[Human-reported]` / `[Code-fact]` / `[Literature]` are defined in `research-discussion.md`.)

The recurring failure is bolting citations, evidence chains, and firm claims onto thinking the human floated as a guess. When a passage answers to no external arbiter, add no evidence machinery.

**Detecting the register — surface cues, hard default:**

- run id / metric / "ran" / "measured" / a result → experiment.
- "I think" / "我猜" / "maybe" / "先记着" → judgment.
- no experiment/paper/code signal → judgment → add nothing.
- can't tell → judgment, and ask ONE question. Never default to formalize.
- a sentence that folds an experiment clause into a guess and self-cancels it ("跑了一把好像 X，但没固定别的变量，先不算数") stays one loose paragraph; do not lift the clause into an Experiment Record.

**Inherit the stance:**

- Revising existing text → preserve its facts, claim boundaries, chronology,
  causality, uncertainty, and author-source markers. Its expression may change
  when a style-only rewrite is requested or the workspace tone authority rules
  out the old register; do not preserve a battle-report or audit tone merely
  because it appears in the source.
- Writing fresh → inherit the stance the human held (see the Discussion handoff).
- The loose family (conjecture / concept-learning / reflection-decision) shares one rule: add no evidence apparatus; preserve as-is. (Concept notes follow the human's own granularity convention if they have one — see Language Policy.)

### Information budget for human-facing prose

Record reproduction details once where they support the result. After a table or
compact experiment record, preserve any supplied observation, interpretation,
and limits without repeating the full audit trail. In a source-constrained
transformation, do not fill an absent explanation or limitation. Completion
reports, hashes, gates, and dispatch records can be evidence sources, but they
are not the register of a research log.

### Explain a limitation that changes the conclusion

When a supplied limitation materially narrows the main claim, state that
limitation plainly. Expand it only when the source already contains the
concrete mismatch, its possible effect, and the narrower conclusion. Otherwise
do not supply that reasoning merely to make the record feel complete. In
explicit AI synthesis, a new explanation of the limitation is an AI claim and
needs its own literal `[AI finding/claim]` marker.

## Experiment Record — FORBIDDEN unless this passage is accountable to DATA

Driven by one question, not a form:

> Will future-me need to CITE or DEFEND this? If yes, write what a skeptic would demand. If no, one line.

Three tiers, never losing data silently:

- **Throwaway** → one line + tag + the run id if one exists.
- **"Might matter"** (default when unsure / unflagged) → run id + config + one-line result.
- **Load-bearing** → preserve every supplied hypothesis, prediction, controls / held-fixed condition, run id / config / seed, result, falsification check, and bounded conclusion. “Load-bearing” means not losing reproduction information already in the source; it does not authorize completing a missing hypothesis, prediction, falsification check, alternative, or conclusion.

Take only the methodology (hypothesis, prediction, controls, reproducibility, bounded conclusion, falsification), never the rhetoric (formal prose, decorative citation, hedge-free narrative). Even here, stay in plain short-sentence voice.

## Revising an Existing Log (causal constraint)

A log dated T is a point-in-time record of what was known and thought on day T. When you revise it, you may use ONLY information available at or before T. Be the day-T author, not a later one.

For a style-only revision, this means changing expression while keeping the
same day-T content, paragraph order where practical, claim boundaries,
provenance markers, and stated uncertainty. It does not authorize a new
explanation, correction, or hindsight note.

- The only legitimate edit is **relaxing an over-claim to the register it deserved THAT DAY**: a conjecture written as a proven claim becomes a conjecture again, because it *was* a conjecture on day T. This needs no future knowledge — whether something had been tested yet is a day-T fact.
- **Forbidden — hindsight.** Do not import a later result, do not add "(this turned out wrong)", do not harden or soften a passage because of how it played out. The day-T author could not know that. Backward dependence (citing an experiment from before T) is fine; forward dependence is not.
- A correction or retraction lives in the **later** log where the new knowledge was acquired, dated when it was known — never retro-injected into the past log.
- Do not add a falsification framing to a source-constrained revision. In explicit AI synthesis, a new day-T design question is an AI proposition and needs its own literal `[AI finding/claim]` marker; never phrase it via a later outcome.
- A flag is only valid if it is **outcome-independent**: the passage was over-claimed relative to its day-T evidence regardless of how it later turned out. If a passage would have been fine to write that day and is suspect only because of what happened next, do not touch it.
- Reality check after the edit: the day-T author would say "yes, I should have written it that way then" — not "I couldn't have known that." If the second, you imported the future; revert.

## Evidence and Reasoning Labels

These labels are available for passages accountable to data, a paper, or code (see "Register and Accountability"). They are not required, and they do **not** apply to judgment-only passages — do not label a conjecture, a design intuition, or a decision as a Claim with Evidence. Use a label only where it adds traceability the passage actually owes someone. (Provenance tags are defined in `research-discussion.md`.)

- Observation: directly seen in experiment logs, plots, metrics, audio, code, or user-provided facts.
- Hypothesis: plausible explanation not yet proven.
- Claim: interpretation or technical statement.
- Evidence: paper, experiment result, code inspection, diagnostic output, or user-provided source.
- Decision: human-approved direction, temporary direction, or constraint.
- Consequence: expected effect on model, loss, training, code, experiments, or documentation.
- Open Question: unresolved item requiring evidence, experiment, literature check, or code inspection.

If evidence is missing, mark the statement as a hypothesis, assumption, human intuition, or needs verification. Do not fabricate citations, paper claims, experiment results, run IDs, code behavior, or file paths.

## Language Policy

Research logs may preserve mixed language, informal phrasing, and original terminology. Do not force full English unless requested. Preserve technical terms when translation would reduce precision.

If the human maintains personal log-form conventions (notation gloss, symbol-collision rules, math formatting, attribution rules, concept-note granularity), honor them; they govern form, this file governs register and rigor.

## Delivery Scope

When the human asks to write or rewrite log content, return the requested prose.
Do not add a frontmatter block, storage-path suggestion, file-operation report,
or a second “next steps” artifact unless the human explicitly asks for it or
provides a destination-file workflow.

### Keep the supplied shape unless organization is needed

For a fresh log whose material has no supplied title or section structure,
deliver it as ordinary prose following the natural order of the supplied
paragraphs and tables. Do not manufacture a date title, an “Open Question”
section, a derived artifact, or a filename. Those additions make a short
research record look like a completion package and can imply a priority the
human did not set. Add the smallest useful heading only when the human asks for
structure, or when genuinely separate topics would otherwise change meaning.

### Fixed conditions do not settle attribution

Report a confirmed matching configuration, hash, seed, or other fixed condition
as a method or reproducibility fact. It does not, by itself, establish that a
difference is not due to data or configuration, rule out every alternative, or
locate the cause in a module. Such exclusion or causal language needs evidence
in the supplied material; otherwise leave it out or state it as a question to
be tested. This distinction matters because a reproducible comparison can be
well controlled while its remaining performance difference is still not
localized.

## Optional Section Menu (not a checklist)

This is a MENU, not a form. Pick only the sections that serve this entry; an entry that is three lines of conjecture is complete with zero of these sections. Empty slots invite over-filling — do not add a section just because it exists.

```markdown
# <Date> — <Research Topic>

## Context  — why this note exists; the research state that led to it.

### Loose-thinking sections (judgment-only — no evidence apparatus)
## Raw Notes / Human Thinking  — informal thoughts, doubts, intuitions, conjecture, brainstorming.
## Decision / Temporary Direction  — the call + the human's stated reason. Mark tentative items tentative.
## Failed or Rejected Paths  — path — why rejected / deferred / unresolved.
## Open Questions  — question needing experiment, literature, code, or a human decision.

### Externally-accountable sections (invoke only when that arbiter is present)
## Observations  — facts directly seen in a run, plot, metric, audio, code, paper. Tag provenance.
## Hypotheses  — use the hypothesis-registry table ONLY if this log uses H_n labels (the table format is the human's convention; see Language Policy).
## Experiment Record  — invoke ONLY for a real experiment; size it by the question in "Register and Accountability" (one line for a sanity check; the full record only for a load-bearing result).
## Evidence  — paper / experiment / code pointers, when a claim owes one.

## Possible Derived Artifacts  — decision/progress · task · reference (pointers only).
```

## Rules

1. Preserve uncertainty. Do not convert speculative ideas into confirmed design decisions.
2. Keep failed ideas and rejected alternatives when they matter for future reasoning.
3. Mark tentative decisions as tentative.
4. Separate observation from interpretation.
5. Do not fabricate citations. If a paper is mentioned without details, cite it as a pointer needing verification.
6. Mark implementation-relevant fragments only when helpful; do not make the entire log code-agent-facing.
7. Keep the human's conceptual vocabulary unless it is technically misleading.
8. Do not split a single Obsidian page into multiple files unless the human asks for multiple artifacts.

## Do Not

- Do not default to English-only output.
- Do not default to code-agent-facing style.
- Do not erase Q&A-like reasoning if it helps preserve the research process.
- Do not replace human uncertainty with a polished narrative.
- Do not turn the log into a progress note, task, or reference unless explicitly requested.
